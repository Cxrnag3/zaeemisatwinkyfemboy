A cookie is a small, flat, sweet baked treat made from dough, typically featuring flour, sugar, butter/fat, and eggs, with additions like chocolate chips, nuts, or oats, varying in texture from crispy to chewy and known as biscuits in many countries. Cookies serve as popular snacks or desserts, originating from Dutch "koekje" (little cake) and evolving globally with many varieties like drop cookies, bar cookies, and shaped cookies.
